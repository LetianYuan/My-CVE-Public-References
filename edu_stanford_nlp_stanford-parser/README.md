# Code injection Vulnerability in edu.stanford.nlp:stanford-parser:3.6.0

**Affected Version**

The latest version 3.9.2 and below.

**Affected Components**

```
edu/stanford/nlp/io/IOUtils.java
```

**Describe the Vulnerability**

There is a method, `edu.stanford.nlp.io.getBZip2PipedInputStream`, designed to get an `InputStream`. However, passing an unchecked argument to this API can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands. For instance, following codes can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands from attackers:

```java
        System.setProperty("bzcat", "calc");
        try {
            IOUtils.getBZip2PipedInputStream("");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
```

**To Reproduce**

Just execute above codes will reproduce it.

**Fix Suggestion**

Strictly check whether `System.getProperty("bzcat", "bzcat")` returns the path of bzcat executable.
